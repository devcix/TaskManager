## Notes and next development ideas
Note that this is a project put together with little forewarning, or prepairation, and is done simply to show that the developer
as a pretty solid grasp of concepts and ideas behind coding and designing a proper angular app.  This is said to also note
that there are still things the developer knows he has to learn, and many tricks and techniuqes that would serve to make him
an even better developer.

As it stands now the project is a simple list server, serving a predefined list of items representing task.  It's very basic
in it's structure, and there are a great many bells and whistlse that might be added at a later time.  Some of these ideas follow:

* Date/Time picker
* Registration/authentication system
* Database integration for
* * Users / Administration
  * Login and security
  * Projects (Expanding the scope of the projects)
  * document upload and display
* Integrating Material, or other aestetics libraries
* Email communications systems
